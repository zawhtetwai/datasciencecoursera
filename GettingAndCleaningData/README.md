#Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1
The dataset for this assignment is the Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. The task is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 and to construct the 4 plots using the base plotting system. 

##Deliverables for the assignment
* README.MD
* household_power_consumption.txt ("Electric power consumption" dataset)
* load_data.R that read the dataset into R. The it loads the data for the period between 2007-02-01 to 2007-02-02.
* 4 R scripts to produce the 4 plot images
  -plot1.R <br/>
  -plot2.R <br/>
  -plot3.R <br/>
  -plot4.R <br/>
* 4 plots that are saved in PNG file format with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
  -plot1.png <br/>
  -plot2.png <br/>
  -plot3.png <br/>
  -plot4.png <br/> 

##Prerequisites for the script (run_analysis.R)
* R 3.1.1 <br/>

1. Clone "https://github.com/zawhtetwai/ExData_Plotting1" from GitHub using git clone command.
2. Launch the RGUI.
3. Set the working directroy using setwd("to the folder that cloned from GitHub in Step#1")
4. Type 'source("plot1.R")' without single quote for plot1.png.
5. Type 'source("plot2.R")' without single quote for plot2.png.
6. Type 'source("plot3.R")' without single quote for plot3.png.
7. Type 'source("plot4.R")' without single quote for plot4.png.
